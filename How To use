It uses the JSON and the REQUESTS packages, so you might have to install them by typing "pip3 install requests" and 
"pip3 install Json" in your terminal. I only use a Mac, so there might be bugs if you use it on Windows.
So, all the commands you might need:
pip3 install requests
pip3 install json
pip3 install PyQt5==5.9.2



To use it, you have to download the .py and the .JSON file. They have to be in the same folder. Then you navigate with your 
Terminal to that folder (using "cd /folder/path" on mac, idk about windows. On mac you can just type cd and then drag the 
folder inside the command prompt). if you are there, type python3 BazaarViewer in the terminal. (Again, on MacOs you can just 
type Python3 and then drag the python file in the terminal).
Then you should get asked, what product you want to see the price of. NOT ALL PRODUCTS ARE CURRENTLY SUPPORTED, ONLY THOSE IN
THE PRICES.JSON FILE!!

Everything should work, if not write me a message on Discord, I am P337#1980
